Course Results block by Vlas Voloshin
argentum@cdp.tsure.ru

This course block shows information about highest grades in a course on some grade item.
It was created on the base of quiz results block, but instead of quiz results it shows information about any grades in a course: course item grades, grade category results or whole course grades.
Block title, header and footer can be changed in settings as well as grade item to show and other settings.

Installation:
Unzip to /moodle/blocks/, then go to admin notification page to finish installation.
Add it to course page like any other block, and don't forget to configure it.

If you have any bugs to report or extra functionality to suggest, you can use tracker.moodle.org: just create an issue in "Non-core contributed modules" with "Block: Course results" component.
