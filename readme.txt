Course Results block initially developed by Vlas Voloshin
Current maintainer: Artem Andreev (aav@inobr.ru)

This course block shows information about highest grades in a course on some grade item.
It was created on the base of quiz results block, but instead of quiz results it shows information about any grades in a course: course item grades, grade category results or whole course grades.
Block title, header and footer can be changed in settings as well as grade item to show and other settings.

Installation:
Unzip contents of folder inside archive to /moodle/blocks/course_results/, then go to admin notification page to finish installation.
Add it to course page like any other block, and don't forget to configure it.
